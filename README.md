# Key Features:

## A Modern Save Editor 📝
Step aside Hex Editors, MudkiPC is now the easiest way to edit your save files and Pokémon. Plus, you can even transfer Pokémon to another game and even Pokémon Showdown!

## Cross-Platform 🖥️📱💻
MudkiPC is built using Dart & Flutter, which in layman's terms mean that it can run any modern device, including Linux!

## Blazingly Fast 🚀
With SQLite at its core, MudkiPC is bar none the fastest way to search and find your Pokémon... or anything for that matter.

## Completely Self-Contained 🗄️
Hate how most apps today require dependencies and a constant internet connection to work? Well, do not worry. MudkiPC is completely self reliant, no extra-downloads needed.

## Extremely Detailed 🔎
Ever wanted to know the true size of Wailord? No? Well, now you can. Thanks to the hard working [PokéAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi?tab=readme-ov-file) team, MudkiPC can give you nifty graphs, height charts, spreadsheets, and every other nerdy way to show data. Neat right?

# Why MudkiPC?
Because Mudkip is my favorite Pokémon. MudkiPC is just combination of Mudkip and PC. Mudkip + PC = MudkiPC. Simple!

## How do you pronounce it?
You can pronounce it in two ways:
- *Mud*-*Ki*-*P*-*C*
- or
- *Mud*-*Kip*-*C*

It does not matter, choose one or the other.
