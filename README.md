# Key Features:

## A Modern Save Editor üìù

Step aside Hex Editors, MudkiPC is now the easiest way to edit your trainers and Pok√©mon. Want to move an old trainer to a newer game? Now you can, its that simple! Plus, you can even transfer Pok√©mon to another game and even Pok√©mon Showdown!

## Cross-Platform\* üñ•Ô∏èüì±üíª

MudkiPC is built using Dart & Flutter, which in layman's terms mean that it can run any modern device, including Linux and mobile!

(MacOS and iOS versions are currently impossible for me to compile, as I do not have a Mac system. Looking into getting one though!)

## Native Look & Feel üñ±Ô∏è

Every operating system has their own unique look and feel, so why not talor MudkiPC to the OS itself? MudkiPC will look, feel, and act like it was made specifically for your device, leaning into the strengths of your OS. If you prefer different look or want your phone and desktop to look the same, you can change it on the fly.

### Windows

### And more to come...

## Blazingly Fast üöÄ

With SQLite at its core, MudkiPC is bar none the fastest way to search and find your Pok√©mon... or anything for that matter.

## Completely Self-Contained üóÑÔ∏è

Hate how most apps today require dependencies and a constant internet connection to work? Well, do not worry. MudkiPC is completely self reliant, no extra-downloads needed.

## Extremely Detailed üîé

Ever wanted to know the true size of Wailord? No? Well, now you can. Thanks to the hard working [Pok√©API](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi?tab=readme-ov-file) team, MudkiPC can give you nifty graphs, height charts, spreadsheets, and every other nerdy way to show data. Neat right?

# Why MudkiPC?

Because Mudkip is my favorite Pok√©mon. MudkiPC is just combination of Mudkip and PC. Mudkip + PC = MudkiPC. Simple!

## How do you pronounce it?

You can pronounce it in two ways:

- _Mud_-_Ki_-_P_-_C_

  or

- _Mud_-_Kip_-_C_

It does not matter, choose one or the other.

# Consider Sponsoring ‚ù§Ô∏è

I would love to continue working on this for the foreseeable future, however, I am currently in school and this project is a lot of work. Consider sponsoring me on GitHub so I can continue working on this project! If you can't, no worries, you can spread the word about this project instead. Thanks!
