## Cross-Platform 🖥️📱💻
MudkiPC is built using Dart & Flutter, which in layman's terms mean that it can run any modern device, including Linux!

## Blazingly Fast 🚀
With a SQLite database at its core, MudkiPC is bar none the fastest way to find your Pokémon... or anything for that matter.

## Completely Self-Contained 🗄️
Hate how most apps today require dependencies and a constant internet connection to work? Well, do not worry. MudkiPC is completely self reliant, no extra-downloads needed.

## Extremely Detailed 🔎
Ever wanted to know the true size of Wailord? No? Well, now you can thanks to the hard working [PokéAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi?tab=readme-ov-file) team.
